### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ Im Sergei Cherkasov
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on improving my data science skills through online courses at [DataCamp](https://www.datacamp.com/portfolio/srjchsv) to help businesses and consumers using data.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning python, pandas, statistics.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on data science projects.
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with getting a job as junior data scientist.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about data science.
- ðŸ“« Reach me on [Linkedin](https://linkedin.com/in/srjchsv)
- âš¡ Fun fact: For around 4 years I tried almost every programming language and technology out there to build frontend, backend, CI/CD, IaC, cloud, data science products and services. In none of these I got really far beyond 'Hello, World!'. Now being consistent and focusing on learning and doing data science will try to fix it =)
